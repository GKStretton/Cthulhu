# About Mega_Heat_Cam_with_Shield
This example illustrates the use of the Cthulhu as a sensory substitution device paired with the Quicc GRID-Eye Infrared Array to sense the warmth of objects. When a warm object is sensed by the Infrared Array, the LEDs on the Cthulhu will light up, and the corresponding electrodes on the removable flexible array will be stimulated.
