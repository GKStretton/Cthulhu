Tactile Waves Cthulhu Demo
==========================
This app shows how the [Tactile Waves Android library](https://github.com/Funkatronics/TactileWaves "Tactile Waves") can be used with the Cthulhu Shield to build a sound-to-touch sensory substitution system.

Tactile Waves is used to capture and process audio from the devices microphone to extract its fundamental frequency (pitch) and formant frequencies. These frequencies are drawn to the screen for visualization. 

An Arduino equipped with a Cthulhu Shield can be connected to the app via USB or Bluetooth (using the 3-dot overflow menu on the app's toolbar). When connected, the formant frequencies will be mapped and sent to the Cthulhu LEDs/electrodes.
